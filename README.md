# Check Links
### Review the web addresses of all links in a draft message.

Never send an email with broken or incorrect links again.  With the Check Links extension for Thunderbird, you can review the web addresses (URLs) of all hyperlinks in a draft email message before sending.

Learn more and install the Thunderbird extension from the [AE Creations website](https://aecreations.io/checklinks/index.php). Check Links is also available from [Add-ons for Thunderbird](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/checklinks/).
